Hello!
Thank you for downloading my font 'Sunbreath', which is free for personal use. If you would like to use this font for items for sale you have to buy Extended License here: http://crtv.mk/d0X4n

You can purchase a PRO version of the font  which comes with roman and cyrillic typeface and special glyphs (so the font can be used with most of the European languages) here: http://crtv.mk/h0aOR
